# Each Jupyter Notebook in the repository follows a similar structure

- Introduction: Overview of the disease and dataset.

- Data Preprocessing: Steps to preprocessed the data for training.

- Model Building: Implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or other relevant models.

- Model Training: Training the model and tuning hyperparameter.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Model Saving: Saving the best-performing model to the models/ directory.

## Best Models

The best models for each disease, along with their performance metrics, are saved in the respective models/ directories. These models will be integrated into the AI platform for real-world use.
